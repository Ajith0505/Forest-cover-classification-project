# Forest-cover-classification-project

# Problem Statement
We have been given a total of 54 attributes, these attributes contain Binary and Quantative attributes , and we to predict which Forest Cover-Type is it from the given features.  
Each observation is 30m x 30m forest cover type determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data.
The target variable has 7 different classes hence making this a Multi-Class Classification problem.

Dataset attribute info :

•	No. of Instances 581,011

•	No. of Attributes (Features)1 54

•	Associate Task Classification Dataset 

•	Characteristic Multivariate Attribute Characteristic Categorical, Integer

•	Missing Value None

•	Area Life

•	Target Variable Forest Cover Type
